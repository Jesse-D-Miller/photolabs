# PhotoLabs Project

Photolabs is a dynamic photo gallery web app that allows users to browse, filter, and favourite images by topic. Built with React and powered by a PostgreSQL/Express backend, it supports interactive modals, topic-based filtering, and persistent favourites. The project showcases client-server communication, state management with useReducer, and real-time UI updates based on user interaction.
